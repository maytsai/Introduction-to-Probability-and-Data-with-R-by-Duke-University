# Probability-and-Data-with-R-by-Duke-University
 
Through the entire five week courses, we have learned the full ideas of probability and the data structures to build a R project from 0 to 1. 

## Project Workflow

You can find my Data Analysis project using R- Exploring the BRFSS data in the week 5 folder.

**Title:** Exploring the BRFSS data
**Date:** 06/28/2021

**Data Source:**
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about local U.S. residents.

The survey regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.

Factors accessed by the organization include: 

- Tobacco use 
- HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention 
- Exercise 
- Health status ( Immunization, days, related quality of life, Health care acces, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions) 
- Mental Health 
- Inadequate sleep 
- Hypertension awareness) 
- Individual Food Consumption(alcohol consumption,fruits and vegetables consumption ) 
- arthritis burden

BRFSS collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

With the large data set acquired by extent collective area, we can assume that the survey was obtained by random sampling. The survey was scope by the method of gerneralizability.

Since it is not a random assignment, only correlation can imply to the result but not causation.

## Analysis Purpose:

Controlling my diet for the past few years, I am especially interest in how Binge drinking correlated with demographic and the mental/physical health of respondents.

**Research Question 1:** How does Binge Drinking vary between gender and states?

**Research Question 2:** How does Binge Drinking correlate with poor mental health status and poor physical health status?

**Research Question 3:** How does Education Level, Employment Status, and Income Level relate to Binge Drinking?


You can observed the full process of how I manipualate the BRFSS 2013 dataset to find the three research answers, Enjoy!
